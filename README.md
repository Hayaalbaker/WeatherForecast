# Swifters Club: 1st Session  
**"Views, Structures, and Properties"**

## Experimenting with SwiftUI  
This repository is for Swifters Club members to experiment with **views**, **structures**, and **properties** in SwiftUI. Use this space to practice building a **multiday weather forecast app** and explore how to customize views with properties.

If you ever feel lost, you can refer back to this [Apple tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/customize-views-with-properties) or contact me for guidance.

## Goals  
- Learn how to use **properties** to customize views.  
- Build and reuse **structures** for efficient code.  
- Experiment with creating a simple weather app.
